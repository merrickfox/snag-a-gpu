# Snag a GPU

Script to check Scan UK for Nvidia 30 series cards. Will send an alert over slack if they are in stock or can be preordered. For use only for those who genuinely need an upgrade. 


Requirements:
* Personal slack instance (for alerts, add your key in `alerter.js`)

To run: `docker-compose up --build`

The script is simple and is easily extendable and customisable.

I got my upgrade, go nuts.
